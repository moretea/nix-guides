# Nix Guides

Welcome to Nix Guides!
With this set of guides targetted at new Nix users, we hope to give a gentle introduction to the 
Nix universe.

Our goal is to have a set of guides that take you, the end-user, through all the steps you need
in a sequential order to accomplish certain tasks.
The Nix, Nixpkgs, and NixOs manuals are great as reference manuals, but are not good to use as
learning material.


### Why bother learning Nix?
We believe that Nix has a unique value proposition. It offers **declarative specifications** of
software packages, machine configurations and even cloud resources.
It is **reliable**, by not ever replacing components. This makes **atomic upgrades and rollbacks**
easy and safe.

### What to read next
If you're completely new to Nix, we recommend to take a quick peek at the [Overview](overview.md),
and then follow the [Getting Started Tutorial](getting-started-tutorial.md).
From there on you can pick any guide in any order you like.
